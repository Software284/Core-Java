Anonymous Inner Class:-> sometimes we can declare inner class without name such type of inner classes are called
anonymous inner classes.
the main purpose of anonymous inner classes is just for instant use(one time usage).
if we have 100 methods in parent class but we want to inherit only one method from parent class at that 
situation anonymous inner class that extends class is best suitable instead of inheritance relationship.

based on declaration and behaviour there are three types of anonymous inner classes:->

i. anonymous inner class that extends a class
ii. anonymous inner class that implements a interface
iii. anonymous inner class that defines inside arguments


Anonymous inner class that extends a class:-> 
Thread t = new Thread();
Thread t  = new Thread()
{
};

Generated class names of example are:->
PopCorn.class
Test.class
Test$1.class
Test$2.class

PopCorn p = new PopCorn(); :=> just we are creating PopCorn object.
PopCorn p =  new PopCorn()
{
};
-> we are declaring a class that extends PopCorn without name(anonymous inner class).
-> for that child class we are creating an object with parent reference.

PopCorn p = new PopCorn()
{
	public void taste(){
	syosut("Spicy");
	}
};
-> we are declaring a class that extends PopCorn without name(anonymous inner class).
-> in that child class we are overriding taste method.
-> for that child class we are creating an object with parent reference.

-> defining a thread by extending thread class 

Normal approach vs Annomoys approach:-> 

Normal:->
class MyThread extends Thread{
	public void run(){
		for(int i = 0; i<10; i++){
			System.out.println("Child Thread");
		}
}

class ThreadDemo{
	public static void main(String args[]){
		MyThread  t = new MyThread();
		t.start();
		for(int i = 0; i<10; i++){
			System.out.println("Main Thread");
		}
		
	}
}

Anonymous:->
class ThreadDemo {
	public static void main(String args[]){
		Thread t = new Thread(){
			public void run(){
				for(int i = 0; i<10; i++){
					System.out.println("Child Thread");
		         }
			}
		};
		t.start();
		for(int i = 0; i<10; i++){
			System.out.println("Main Thread");
		}
		
	}
}

Anonymous inner class that implements a interface:-> 
Normal approach:->
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
	public void run(){
		for(int i=0;i<=10;i++){
		 System.out.println("Child Thread");
		}
	}
}

class ThreadDemo {
	public static void main(String args[]){
		MyRunnable r = new Runnable();
		Thread t = new Thread(r);
		t.start();
		for(int i=0;i<=10;i++){
			System.out.println("Main Thread");
		}
	}
}

Anonymous approach:->
class ThreadDemo {
	public static void main(String args[]){
		Runnable r = new Runnable(){
			public void run(){
				for(int i=0;i<=10;i++){
		 			System.out.println("Child Thread");
		        }
			}
		};
		Thread t = new Thread(r);
		t.start();
		for(int i=0;i<=10;i++){
		 	System.out.println("Main Thread");
		}
	}
}


Anonymous inner class that defines inside arguments:-> 
class ThreadDemo {
	public static void main(String args[]){
		Thread t = new Thread(new Runnable(){
			public void run(){
				for(int i=0;i<=10;i++){
					System.out.println("Child Thread");
				}
			}
		});
		
		for(int i=0;i<=10;i++){
		 	System.out.println("Main Thread");
		}
		
	}
}

Normal java class vs Anonymous Inner Class:->
-> normal java class can extends only one class at a time of course anonymous inner class also can extends
only one class at time.
-> a normal java class can implement any no of interfaces simulatanously but anonymous inner class can
implement only one interface at a time.
