Various Combination of Nested classes and interfaces:->

case-I:class inside a class -> without exsisting one type of object if there is no chance of existing another type of object
then we can declare class inside a class.
Example: university consists of several departments
without existing university there is no chance of existing department hence we have to declare department 
class inside university class.
class University{
	class Department{
	}
}

case-II: interface inside a class:-> inside a class if we required multiple implementation of an interfce
and all these implementation are related to particular class then we can define interface inside a
class.
Example:
class VehicleTypes {
	interface Vehicle {
		public int getNoOfWheels();
	}
	
	class Bus implements Vehicle {
		public int getNoOfWheels(){
			return 6;
		}
	}
	
	class Auto implements Vehicle{
		public int getNoOfWheels(){
			return 3;
		}
	}
}
