Various Combination of Nested classes and interfaces:->

case-I:class inside a class -> without exsisting one type of object if there is no chance of existing another type of object
then we can declare class inside a class.
Example: university consists of several departments
without existing university there is no chance of existing department hence we have to declare department 
class inside university class.
class University{
	class Department{
	}
}

case-II: interface inside a class:-> inside a class if we required multiple implementation of an interfce
and all these implementation are related to particular class then we can define interface inside a
class.
Example:
class VehicleTypes {
	interface Vehicle {
		public int getNoOfWheels();
	}
	
	class Bus implements Vehicle {
		public int getNoOfWheels(){
			return 6;
		}
	}
	
	class Auto implements Vehicle{
		public int getNoOfWheels(){
			return 3;
		}
	}
}

case-III:interface inside interface:-> we can declare interface inside interface.
Example:-> a map is a group of key value pairs and each key value pair is called an entry.without 
existing map object there is no chance of existing entry object hence interface entry is defined 
inside map interface.
interface Map {
	interface Entry{
	}
}
