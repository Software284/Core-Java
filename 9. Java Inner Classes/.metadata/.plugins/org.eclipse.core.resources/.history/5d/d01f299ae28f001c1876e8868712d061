Inner Classes:-> 
-> sometimes we can declare a class inside another class such type of classes are called
inner classes.inner classes concept introduce in 1.1 version to fix GUI bugs as a part of event handling
but because of powerful features and benefits of inner classes slowly programmer started using in regular
coding also.
-> without existing one type of object if there is no chance of existing another type of object then we
should go for inner classes.

-> example1,university consists of several departments without existing university there is no chance of
existing department hence we have to declare department class inside university class.
class Univerisity{
	class Departments{
	}
}

-> example2,without existing car object there is no chance of existing engine object hence we have to 
declare engine class inside car class.
class Car {
	class Engine{
	}
}

-> example3,map is a group of key value pairs and each key value pair is called an entry,without existing
map object there is no chance of existing entry object hence interface entry is defined inside map 
interface.
interface map {
	interface entry{
	}
}
