Anonymous Inner Class:-> sometimes we can declare inner class without name such type of inner classes are called
anonymous inner classes.
the main purpose of anonymous inner classes is just for instant use(one time usage).
if we have 100 methods in parent class but we want to inherit only one method from parent class at that 
situation anonymous inner class that extends class is best suitable instead of inheritance relationship.

based on declaration and behaviour there are three types of anonymous inner classes:->

i. anonymous inner class that extends a class
ii. anonymous inner class that implements a interface
iii. anonymous inner class that defines inside arguments


Anonymous inner class that extends a class:-> 
Thread t = new Thread();
Thread t  = new Thread()
{
};

Generated class names of example are:->
PopCorn.class
Test.class
Test$1.class
Test$2.class

PopCorn p = new PopCorn(); :=> just we are creating PopCorn object.
PopCorn p =  new PopCorn()
{
};
-> we are declaring a class that extends PopCorn without name(anonymous inner class).
