Method Local Inner Class:-> sometimes we can declare a class inside a method such type of inner classes are
called method local inner classes.

the main purpose main method local inner class is to define method specific repeteadly required functionality
.method local inner classes are best suitable to meet nested method requirements.

if we need to write 50k lines of code inside the method then we need to define a nested metod but in java
nested method is not available.so we need to write method in the class level but what happen if this method
is required only inside the method.for this problem solution method local inner classes are best 
suitable.

we can access method level inner classes only within the method where we declared outside of the method we
can't access.because of it's less scope method local inner classes are most rarely used type of inner classes

.

we can declare method local inner class inside both instance and static methods.

if we declare inner class inside instance method then from that method local inner class we can access both
static and non-static members of outer class directly.

if we declare inner class inside static method then we can access only static members of outer class directly
from that method local inner class.

from method local inner class we can't access local variables of the method in which we declared inner class.
if the local variable declared as final then we can access.
