Method Local Inner Class:-> sometimes we can declare a class inside a method such type of inner classes are
called method local inner classes.

the main purpose main method local inner class is to define method specific repeteadly required functionality
.method local inner classes are best suitable to meet nested method requirements.

if we need to write 50k lines of code inside the method then we need to define a nested metod but in java
nested method is not available.so we need to write method in the class level but what happen if this method
is required only inside the method.for this problem solution method local inner classes are best 
suitable.
