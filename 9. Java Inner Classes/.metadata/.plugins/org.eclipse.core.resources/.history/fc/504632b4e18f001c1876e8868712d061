Inner Classes:-> 
-> sometimes we can declare a class inside another class such type of classes are called
inner classes.inner classes concept introduce in 1.1 version to fix GUI bugs as a part of event handling
but because of powerful features and benefits of inner classes slowly programmer started using in regular
coding also.
-> without existing one type of object if there is no chance of existing another type of object then we
should go for inner classes.
-> example1,university consists of several departments without existing university there is no chance of
existing department hence we have to declare department class inside university class.
class Univerisity{
	class Departments{
	}
}
