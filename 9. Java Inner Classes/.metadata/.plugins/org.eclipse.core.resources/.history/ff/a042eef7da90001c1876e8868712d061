Static Nested Inner Classes:-> sometimes we can declare inner class with static modifier such type of inner
classes are called static nested classes.
in the case of normal or regular inner class without existing outer class object there is no chance of 
existing inner class object that is inner class object is strongly associated with outer class object.
but in the case of static nested classes without existing outer class object there may be a chance of 
existing nested class object hence static nested class object is not strongly associated with outer class
object.

if we want to create nested class object from outside of outer class then we can create as follows:->
Outer.Nested nested = new Outer.Nested();

in normal or regular inner classes we can't declare any static members.but in static nested classes we can
declare static members including main method hence we can invoke static nested class directly from command
