Need of concurrent package:->
-> 90 percent of the collections are not thread safe so when multiple thread can share same collection
object at the runtime so there will be a chance of occuring problem.AL,LL,HS,TS etc are the example
of collection object which are not thread safe.
-> only 10 percent of the collection classes are thread safe.when one thread accessing the collection
object other thread can't even read it.so it creates performance problems.
-> when one thread iterating a collection object other thread can't even modify that object.it throws
compile time exception concurrentmodificationexcepiton.

Map
ConcurrentMap
ConcurrentHashMap

ConcurrentMap:-> it contains three methods
i. putIfAbsent();
ii. remove();
iii. replace();

Object putIfAbsent(Object key,Object value):->
Example1:->
m.put(101,"durga");
m.put(101,"shive");
sysout(m);

output:->
{101,shive}

m.put(101,"durga");
m.putIfAbsent(101,"shive");

output:->
{101,durga}

boolean remove(Object key,Object value):->
