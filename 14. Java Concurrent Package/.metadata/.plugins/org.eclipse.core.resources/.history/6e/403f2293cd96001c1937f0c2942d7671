 CopyOnWriteArrayList(C)
 
 -> it is a thread safe version of ArrayList as the name indicates CopyOnWriteArrayList creates a clonned copy of underlying ArrayList
 for every update operation at certain point both will synchronize automatically.Which is taking care by JVM internally.
 -> as update operation will be performed on cloned copy there is no effet for the threads which performs read operation.
 -> it is colstly to use because for every update operation a cloned copy will be created.hence CopyOnWriteArrayList is the best 
 choice if several read operations and less number of write operations are required to perfrom.
 -> insertion order is preserved.
 -> duplicate objects are allowed.
 ->heterogeneous objects are allowed.
 -> null insertion is possible.
 -> it implements serializable,clonnable and randomaccess interfaces.
 -> while one thread iterating CopyOnWriteArrayList,the Other threads are allowed to modify and we won't get
 ConcurrentModificationException.that is iterator is Fail Safe.
 -> iterator of arraylist can perform remove operation but iterator of CopyOnWriteArrayList can't Perform remove operation.
 otherwise we will get RuntimeException saying unsupportedoperationexception.
