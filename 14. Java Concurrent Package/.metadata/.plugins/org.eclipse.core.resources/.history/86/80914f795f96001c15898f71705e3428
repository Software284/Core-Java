Need of concurrent package:->
-> 90 percent of the collections are not thread safe so when multiple thread can share same collection
object at the runtime so there will be a chance of occuring problem.AL,LL,HS,TS etc are the example
of collection object which are not thread safe.Vector and HashTable are thread safe.

-> only 10 percent of the collection classes are thread safe.when one thread accessing the collection
object other thread can't even read it.so it creates performance problems.

-> when one thread iterating a collection object other thread can't even modify that object.it throws
compile time exception concurrentmodificationexcepiton.

Map
ConcurrentMap
ConcurrentHashMap

ConcurrentMap:-> it contains three methods
i. putIfAbsent();
ii. remove();
iii. replace();

Object putIfAbsent(Object key,Object value):->
Example1:->
m.put(101,"durga");
m.put(101,"shive");
sysout(m);

output:->
{101,shive}

m.put(101,"durga");
m.putIfAbsent(101,"shive");

output:->
{101,durga}

boolean remove(Object key,Object value):->
m.put(101,"durga");
m.remove(101);

output:->
{}

m.put(101,"durga");
m.remove(101,"durga");

output:-> 
{101=durga}



boolean replace(Object key,Object oldValue,Object newValue):->
m.put(101,"durga");
m.replace(101,"shiva","hari");
sysout(m) //{101=durga}
m.replace(101,"durga","hari");
sysout(m); //{101=hari}

Note:-> these methods not present inside normal map.



ConcurrentHashMap:-> 
-> it is thread safe concurrent collection while normal HashMap is not thread safe.
-> in this map total bucket level lock is implemented instead of enitre hashmap.the initial size of the
map object is 16 so 16 multiple thread are allowed to update the bucket simultaneously while any no of
thread can perform read operation.
-> for each bucket a separate lock is maintained.
-> in hashtable to perform any operation thread required total map object lock but in the case of
concurrent hash map thread won't required total map object lock.thread required segment lock so 
performance of the system will be improved.
