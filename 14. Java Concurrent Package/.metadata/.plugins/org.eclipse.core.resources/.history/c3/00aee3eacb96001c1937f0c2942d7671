 -> it is a thread safe version of ArrayList as the name indicates CopyOnWriteArrayList creates a clonned copy of underlying ArrayList
 for every update operation at certain point both will synchronize automatically.Which is taking care by JVM internally.
 -> as update operation will be performed on cloned copy there is no effet for the threads which performs read operation.
 -> it is colstly to use because for every update operation a cloned copy will be created.hence CopyOnWriteArrayList is the best 
 choice if several read operations and less number of write operations are required to perfrom.
