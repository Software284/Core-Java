Collection(I)
Set(I)
CopyOnWriteArraySet(C)

-> it is a thread safe version of set.
-> internally implemented by CopyOnWriteArrayList.
-> Insertion order is preserved.
-> duplicate object are not allowed.
-> multiple thread can able to perform read operation simultaneously but for every update operation a separate
clonned object will be created.
-> as for every update operation a separate cloned copy will be created which is costly hence if multiple update 
operation are required then it is not recomended to use CopyOnWriteArraySet.
-> while one thread iterating set the other threads are allowed to modify set and we won't get ConcurrentModification
Exception.
-> iterator or CopyOnWriteArraySet can perform only read operation and won't perform remove operation.otherwise
we will get runtime exception unsupportedmethodoperation excepton.
