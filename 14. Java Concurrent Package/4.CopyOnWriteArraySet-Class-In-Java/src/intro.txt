CopyOnWriteArraySet(C)

-> it is a thread safe version of set.
-> internally implemented by CopyOnWriteArrayList.
-> Insertion order is preserved.
-> duplicate object are not allowed.
-> multiple thread can able to perform read operation simultaneously but for every update operation a separate
clonned object will be created.
-> as for every update operation a separate cloned copy will be created which is costly hence if multiple update 
operation are required then it is not recomended to use CopyOnWriteArraySet.
-> while one thread iterating set the other threads are allowed to modify set and we won't get ConcurrentModification
Exception.
-> iterator or CopyOnWriteArraySet can perform only read operation and won't perform remove operation.otherwise
we will get runtime exception unsupportedmethodoperation excepton.

CopyOnWriteArraySet VS synchronizedSet():->
-> it is thread safe because every update operation will be performed on separate cloned copy. VS it is thread safe
because at a time only one thread can perform operation.
->while one thread iterating set,the other threads are allowed to modify and we won't get CME.VS while one thread 
iterating,the other threads are not allowed to modify set otherwise we will get CME.
-> iterator is fail safe VS iterator is fail fase.
-> Iterator can perform only read operation and can't perform remove operation otherwise we will get rumtime exception
saying unsupportedoperationexception. VS iterator can perform both read and remove operation.
-> introduced in 1.5 version VS introduced in 1.2 version.
