ENUM:->
-> if we want to represent a group of named constants then we should go for ENUM.
Example:
enum Month{
	JAN,FEB,MAR,APR,...DEC;
}
enum Beer{
	KO,KF,RC,AO;
}
semicolon is optional.
-> the main objective of ENUM is to define our own data types(enumerated data types).
-> ENUM concept introduced in 1.5 version when compared with old languages ENUM java enum is more powerful.

Internal Implementation of ENUM:->
