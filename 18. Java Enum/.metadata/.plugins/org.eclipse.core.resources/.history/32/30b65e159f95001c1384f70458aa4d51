-> in old languages enum we can't take only constants but in java enum in addition to constants we can take
methods,constructor,normal variables etc.hence java enum is more powerful than old languages enum.

-> even inside java enum we can declare main method and we can run enum class directly from command prompt.

Note:->
-> in addition to constants if we are taking any extraa member like a method then list of constants should
be in the first line and should ends with semicolon.

-> inside enum if we are taking any extra member like a method compulsary the first line should contain
list of constants at least semicolon.
