ENUM:->
-> if we want to represent a group of named constants then we should go for ENUM.
Example:
enum Month{
	JAN,FEB,MAR,APR,...DEC;
}
enum Beer{
	KO,KF,RC,AO;
}
semicolon is optional.
-> the main objective of ENUM is to define our own data types(enumerated data types).
-> ENUM concept introduced in 1.5 version when compared with old languages ENUM java enum is more powerful.

Internal Implementation of ENUM:-> 
enum Beer {
	KF,RC;
}

class Beer{
	public static final Beer KF = new Beer();
	public static final Beer RC = new Beer();
}
-> every enum is internally implemented by using class concept.
-> every enum constant is always public static final.
-> every enum constants represents an object of the type enum.

ENUM Declaration and Usage:->
-> every enum constant is always public static final and hence we can access enum constant by using enum
name.
enum Beer {
	KF,KO,RC,CO;
}
class Test{
	public static void main(String args[]){
		Beer b = Beer.KF;
		System.out.println(b);
	}
}

Note:-> inside enum toString() method is internally implemented to return name of the constants.

-> we can declare enum either within the class or outside of the class but not inside a method.if we are 
trying to declare inside a mehtod then we will get compile time error saying enum types must not be local.

-> if we declare enum outside of the class,the applicable modifiers are public,default,strictfp.
-> if we declare enum inside a class,the applicable modifiers are public,default,strictfp,private,protected,
static.

ENUM VS SWITCH:->
-> until 1.4 version the allowed argument types for the switch statement or byte,short,int,char.but from 
1.5 version onwards corresponding wrapper classes and ENUM types are allowed.from 1.7 version onwards string
type also allowed.
