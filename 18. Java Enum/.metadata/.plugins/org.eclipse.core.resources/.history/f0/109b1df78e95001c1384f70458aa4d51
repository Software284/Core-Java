ENUM:->
-> if we want to represent a group of named constants then we should go for ENUM.
Example:
enum Month{
	JAN,FEB,MAR,APR,...DEC;
}
enum Beer{
	KO,KF,RC,AO;
}
semicolon is optional.
-> the main objective of ENUM is to define our own data types(enumerated data types).
-> ENUM concept introduced in 1.5 version when compared with old languages ENUM java enum is more powerful.

Internal Implementation of ENUM:-> 
enum Beer {
	KF,RC;
}

class Beer{
	public static final Beer KF = new Beer();
	public static final Beer RC = new Beer();
}
-> every enum is internally implemented by using class concept.
-> every enum constant is always public static final.
-> every enum constants represents an object of the type enum.

ENUM Declaration and Usage:->
-> every enum constant is always public static final and hence we can access enum constant by using enum
name.
enum Beer {
	KF,KO,RC,CO;
}
class Test{
	public static void main(String args[]){
		Beer b = Beer.KF;
		System.out.println(b);
	}
}
