Functional Interfaces:-> the interfaces with only one abstract method and any no of default
and static methods are called functional interfaces.
Callable
Comparable
Comparater
Runnable
ActionListener

Predefined functional interfaces:-> these interfaces are present in java.util.function.
Predicate
Function
Consumer
Supplier

Predicate:-> A predicate is a function with a single argument and returns boolean value.
To implement predicate functions in Java, Oracle people introduced Predicate interface in 1.8
version (i.e.,Predicate<T>).
Predicate interface present in Java.util.function package.
It’s a functional interface and it contains only one method i.e., test()

Ex:
 interface Predicate<T> {
 public boolean test(T t);
 }
As predicate is a functional interface and hence it can refers lambda expression.

Predicate Program Sequence:->
predicate program to find greater than ten number or not
predicate program to find length of the string
predicate program to find collection empty or not


Predicate Joining:-> It’s possible to join predicates into a single predicate by using the 
following methods.
and()
or()
negate()
these are exactly same as logical AND ,OR and complement operators

Predicate Program Sequence:->
predicate program with and or and negate method
predicate program to find string start with m letter
predicate program to find emply or null string in list
predicate program for user authentication
predicate program for engineer going to pub or not
predicate program for employee management system

Predicate Interface isEqual() method:->
