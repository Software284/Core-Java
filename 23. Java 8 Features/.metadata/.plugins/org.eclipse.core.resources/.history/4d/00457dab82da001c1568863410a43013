Streams:-> if we want to process the objects from the collections then we should go for streams
concept.io streams meant for representing data with respect to file I/O while util package streams 
meant for process data from collection.

Program sequence:->
program of finding even number in list without streams
program of finding even number in list with stream
program to double list value without stream
program to double list value with stream map configuration

Difference Between map and filter method:->
Streams s = c.stream();
where 
c is any collection object
stream() this method present inside collection interface as default method
Stream is an interface present in java.util.Stream package.

Note: the no of objects because of filter is less than orginal object.in case of
map the orginal objects in list and and new list is always must be same.
