Primitive Type Functional Interface:-> 

1. Autoboxing:
Automatic conversion from primitive type to Object type by compiler is called autoboxing.


2. Autounboxing:
Automatic conversion from object type to primitive type by compiler is called autounboxing.

3. In the case of generics, the type parameter is always object type and no chance of passing
primitive type.
ArrayList<Integer> l = new ArrayList<Integer>();//valid
ArrayList<int> l = new ArrayList<int>();//invalid
