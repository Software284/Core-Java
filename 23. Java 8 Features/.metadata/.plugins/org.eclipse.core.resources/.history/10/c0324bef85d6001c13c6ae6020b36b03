Consumer:-> Sometimes our requirment is we have to provide some input value, perform certain operation, but
not required to return anything,then we should go for Consumer.i.e Consumer can be used to
consume object and perform certain operation.
Consumer Functional Interface contains one abstract method accept.
1) interface Consumer<T>
2) {
3) public void accept(T t);
4) } 

Program sequence:->
consumer program for simple sysout program
consumer program for movie information display
consumer program with predicate and function


Consumer chaining:-> Just like Predicate Chaining and Function Chaining, Consumer Chaining is 
also possible. For this Consumer Functional Interface contains default method andThen().
c1.andThen(c2).andThen(c3).accept(s)
First Consumer c1 will be applied followed by c2 and c3.
