Function:-> 
-> Functions are exactly same as predicates except that functions can return any type of result
but function should (can) return only one value and that value can be any type as per our
requirement.
-> To implement functions oracle people introduced Function interface in 1.8version.
-> Function interface present in Java.util.function package.
-> Functional interface contains only one method i.e., apply()

 

1) interface function(T,R) {
2) public R apply(T t);
3) } 

Predicate VS Function:->
-> to implement condition checks,we should go for predicate VS to perform certain operation and to return some
result we should go for function.
-> Predicate can take one type parameter which represents input argument type. Predicate<T> VS function can take
two parameter.first one represents input argument type and second one represent return type.
Function<T,R>
-> predicate interface defines one abstract method called test() VS function interface defines one abstract
method called apply.
-> public boolean test(T t) VS public R apply(T t);
-> predicate can return only boolean value VS function can return any type of value.

Function program sequence:->
Function functional interface program of length of string
Function functional interface program of counting whitespaces in string
Function functional interface program of finding grade of student
Function functional interface program of total salary of all employee
Function functional interface program of increamenting salary of all employee.

Functional interface Defaults Methods:->

Function Chaining:->We can combine multiple functions together to form more complex functions.For this Function
interface defines the following 2 default methods:
f1.andThen(f2): First f1 will be applied and then for the result f2 will be applied.
f1.compose(f2)===>First f2 will be applied and then for the result f1 will be applied.
identity();

Function program sequence:->
-> Function functional interace program defaults methods.



Functional interface static methods:->what ever we are going to provide to 
this function it will automatically return this values.
static identity();
