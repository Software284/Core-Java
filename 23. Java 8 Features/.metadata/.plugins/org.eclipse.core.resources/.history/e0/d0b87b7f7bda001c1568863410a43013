Method And Constructor Reference by Double Colon Operator:-> in java we can use double colon operator
for method reference and constructor reference.
instead of lambda expression we can go with another alternative to provide implementation which is
called method reference.in this method we can re-use already existing method instead of providing
implementation using lambda expression.
the biggest advantage of method reference is code re-usability.only one condition must be matched
during fulfilling the requirement that is no. of arguments must be matched.
