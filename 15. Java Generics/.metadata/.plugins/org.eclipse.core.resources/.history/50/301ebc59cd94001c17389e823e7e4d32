Generic classses:-> 
-> until 1.4 version a non generic version of array list class declared as follows:-
Class ArrayList{
	add(Object o)
	Object get(int index);
}
-> the argument to add method is object and hence we can add any type of object to the arraylist.due to this we are
missing type safety.
-> the return type of get method is Object hence at the time of retrieval we have to perform type casting.
