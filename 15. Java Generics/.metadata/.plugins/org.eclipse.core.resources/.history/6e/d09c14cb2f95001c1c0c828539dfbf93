Generic classses:-> 
-> until 1.4 version a non generic version of array list class declared as follows:-
class ArrayList{
	add(Object o)
	Object get(int index);
}
-> the argument to add method is object and hence we can add any type of object to the arraylist.due to this we are
missing type safety.
-> the return type of get method is Object hence at the time of retrieval we have to perform type casting.
-> but in 1.5 version a generic version of array list class is declared as follows:->
class ArrayList<T>{
	add(T k);
	T get(int index);
}

-> based on our runtime requirement T will be replaced with our provided type.for example to hold only string type of
objects. a generic version of array list object can be created as follows.

Example:->
ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>
class ArrayList<String>{
	add(String s);
	String get(int index);
}

list.add("durga");
list.add(new Integer(10));
CE:cannot find symbol: method add(java.lang.Integer) location class ArrayList<String>
String s1 = l.get(0);
here type casting is not required.T is called type parameter.

-> in generics we are associating a type parameter to the class such type of parameterized classes are nothing but 
generic classes or template classes.
-> based on our requirement we can define our own generic classes also.
class Account<T>{
}
Account<Gold> a1 = new Account<Gold>();
Account<Platinimu> a2 = new Account<Platinium>();
->see example for full details.

Bounded Types:-> we can bound the type parameter for a particular range by using extends keyword such types are called bounded
types
Example1:->
class Test<T>{
}
-> as the type parameter we can pass any type and there are no restrictions and hence it is unbounded type.

Test<Integer> t1 = new Test<Integer>(); //valid
Test<String> t2 = new Test<String>(); //valid

Example2:->
class Test<T extends Number>{
	
}
-> we can pass either number or it's child classes.
-> this is correct statement
class Test<T implements Runnable>{
}
-> we can pass either runnable or it's implementation classes
-> this is incorrect statement but we can replace imlements with extends.
class Test<T super String>{
}
-> we can pass either string or it's super classes
-> this is incorrect statement.

Note:-> we can define bounded type only using extends keyword.
