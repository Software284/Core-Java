Generics:->
-> the main objectives of generics are to provide type safety and to resolve type casting problems.
-> arrays are type safe that is we can give the gurantee for the type of elements present inside array.
for example:->if our programming requirement is to hold only string type of objects we can choose string
array.by mistake if we are trying to add any other type of objects we will get compile time error.

String[] s = new String[10000];
s[0] = "durga";
s[1] = "ravi";
s[2] = new Integer(10); CE:incompatible type found in java.lang.String
s[2] = "shiva";
