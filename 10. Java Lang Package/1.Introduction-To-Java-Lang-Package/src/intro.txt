Introduction:-> 
-> for writing any java program whether it is simple or complex the most commonly required
classes and interfaces are grouped into a separate package which is nothing but java.lang package.

-> we are not required to import java.lang package explictly because all classes and interfaces present 
in lang package by default available to every java program.

-> Example:
class Test {
	public static void main(String args[]){
		System.out.println("Hello World!!");
	}
}

here Test class implictly extends Test class,String class,System class all are from java.lang package but
we never import those library because java provides them explictly to us.

-> All avaialble classes in java.lang package are
i.Objet
ii.String
iii.StringBuffer
iv.StringBuilder
v.Wrapper 
vi.Autoboxing and Unboxing
