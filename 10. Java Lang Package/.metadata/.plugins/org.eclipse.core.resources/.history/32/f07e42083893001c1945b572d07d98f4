Autoboxing:-> automatic conversion of primitive to wrapper object by compiler is called autoboxing.
Example:
Integer i = 10;
compiler converts int to integer automatically by autoboxing.
after compilation athe aboce line will become 
Integer i = Integer.valueOf(10);
that is internally autoboxing concept is implemented by using valueOf method.


Autounboxing:-> automatic conversion of wrapper object to primitive by compiler is called autounboxing.
Integer I = new Integer(10):
int i = I;
compiler converts Integer to int by autounboxing.after compilation the above line will become 
int i = I.intValue();
that is
