String Constant Pool:-> 
Interning of String objects:-> we can use intern method to get corresponding string constant pool object
reference by using heap object reference.
By using heap object reference if we want to get corresponding SCP object reference then we should go
for intern method.

Example1:->
String s1 = new String("durga");
String s2 = s1.intern();
System.out.println(s1 == s2);
String s3 = "durga";
System.out.println(s2 == s3);

output:->
false
true

Example2:->
String s1 = new String("durga");
String s2 = s1.concat("software");
String s3 = s2.intern();
System.out.println(s2 == s3);
String s4 = "durgasoftware";
System.out.println(s3 == s4);

output:->
true
true

-> if the corresponding SCP object is not available then intern inself will return own object 
reference.

Importance of String Constant Pool:->
->let us consider a program containing the multiple form field with stirng value let's say 12 fields
are there with name,email,city,gender,etc.
-> in our program if a string object is repeatedly required then it is not recomended to create seperate object
for every requirement because it creates performance and memory problems.
-> instead of creating a separate object for every requriement we have to create only one object and we can re-use
the same object for every requirement so that performance and memory utilization will be improved.
-> this thing is possilbe because of SCP hence the main advantages of SCP are memory utilization and performance
will be improved.
