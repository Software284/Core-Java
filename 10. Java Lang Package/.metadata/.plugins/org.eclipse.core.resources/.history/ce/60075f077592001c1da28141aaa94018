StringBuilder:->
-> Every method present in StringBuffer is synchronized and hence only one thread is allowed to 
operate on StringBuffer object at a time.which may creates performance problems.to handle this requriement
sun people introduce StringBuilder concept in 1.5 version.


StringBuilder is exactly same as StringBuffer except the following differences:->
-> Every method present in StringBuffer is synchronized vs Every method present in StringBuilder is non-
synchronized.
-> StringBuffer is thread safe vs StringBuilder is not thread safe
-> it increases waiting time of thread and creates performance problem vs relatively performance is high.
-> StringBuffer comes in 1.0 v vs String builder is comes in 1.5 version.
