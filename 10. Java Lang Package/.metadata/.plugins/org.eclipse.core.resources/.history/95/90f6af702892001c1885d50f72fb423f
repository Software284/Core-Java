String Class:-> 

case-I:
-> once we creates a String object we can't perform any changes in the existing object. if we are
trying to perform any change with those changes a new object will be created. this non-changable behaviour
is nothing but immutability of String of object.

String s = new String("durga");
s.append(" software");
System.out.println(s);

Output:->
durga

-> once we creates StringBugger Object we can perform any type change in the existing object this changeable
behaviour is nothing but mutablility of StringBuffer object.

StringBuffer sb = new StringBugger("durga");
sb.append(" software");
System.out.pritnln(sb);

Output:->
durga software
