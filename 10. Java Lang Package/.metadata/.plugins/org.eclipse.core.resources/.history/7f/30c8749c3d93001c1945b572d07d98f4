Autoboxing:-> automatic conversion of primitive to wrapper object by compiler is called autoboxing.
Example:
Integer i = 10;
compiler converts int to integer automatically by autoboxing.
after compilation athe aboce line will become 
Integer i = Integer.valueOf(10);
that is internally autoboxing concept is implemented by using valueOf method.


Autounboxing:-> automatic conversion of wrapper object to primitive by compiler is called autounboxing.
Integer I = new Integer(10):
int i = I;
compiler converts Integer to int by autounboxing.after compilation the above line will become 
int i = I.intValue();
that is internally autounboxing concept is implemented by using xxxValue method.

Compilation:-> javac -source 1.4
Note:
-> this concept is introduced in java 1.5 version.
-> just becasue autoboxing and autounboxing we can use primitives and wrapper objects interchangably from
1.5 version onwrards.

Example1:->
class Test{
	static Integer I;
	public static void main(String args[]){
		int m = I;
		System.out.pritnln(m);
	}
}

RE:-> Null Pointer Exception

Example2:->
Integer X = 10;
Integer Y = X;
X++;
System.out.pritnln(X);
System.out.println(Y);
System.out.println(X==Y);
