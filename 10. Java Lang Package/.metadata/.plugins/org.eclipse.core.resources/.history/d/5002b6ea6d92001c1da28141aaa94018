StringBuffer:-> 
-> if the content is fixed and won't change frequently then it is recommended to go for String.if the content
is not fixed and keep on changing then it is not recommended to use string because for every change
a new object will be created which affects performance of the system.
to handle this requirement we should go for StringBuffer.
-> the main advantage of StringBuffer over String is all required changes will be performed existing 
object only.

Constructors:-> 

i. StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
-> creates an empty StringBuffer object with default initial capacity 16.once StringBuffer reaches it's
max capacity a new StringBuffer object will be created with new capacity is equal to (current capacity + 1)*2

ii.StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(int initial_capacity);
-> creates an empty StringBuffer object with specified initial capacity.
