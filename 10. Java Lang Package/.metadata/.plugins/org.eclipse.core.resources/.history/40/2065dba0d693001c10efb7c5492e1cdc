Relation Between .equal method and == operator:->
-> if two object are equal by == operator then these object are always equal by .equal method that is
if r1 == r2 is true then r1.equals(r2) is always true.
-> if two objects are not equal by == operator then we can't conclude anything about .equals method.it
may return true or false.that is if r1 == r2 is false then r1.equals(r2) may returns true or false.
