-> a constant value which can be assigned to the variable is called a literal.
int x = 10;
int = datatype/keyword
x = variable/identifier
10 = constant value/literal

Types of literal:->

i. Integral Literals
-> for integral data types(byte,short,int,long) we can specify literal value in the following ways.
	a. decimal literal:->
		-> base 10
		-> allowed digit are 0-9
		-> example int x = 10;
	b. octal literal
		-> base 8
		-> allowed digit are 0-7
		-> example int x = 010;
		-> literal value should be prefixed with 0.
	c. hexa decimal literal
	-> base 16
	-> allowed digit are 0-9,a-f
	-> example int x = 0X10 or 0x10;
	-> literal value should be prefixed with 0X or 0x
	-> for extra digit a-f,we can use both lowercase and uppercase characters.this is one of very few ares
	   where java is not case sensitive.
	   
-> these are only possible ways to specify literal value for integral data types.
