-> a constant value which can be assigned to the variable is called a literal.
int x = 10;
int = datatype/keyword
x = variable/identifier
10 = constant value/literal

Types of literal:->

i. Integral Literals
-> for integral data types(byte,short,int,long) we can specify literal value in the following ways.
	a. decimal literal:->
		-> base 10
		-> allowed digit are 0-9
		-> example int x = 10;
	b. octal literal
		-> base 8
		-> allowed digit are 0-7
		-> example int x = 010;
		-> literal value should be prefixed with 0.
	c. hexa decimal literal
	-> base 16
	-> allowed digit are 0-9,a-f
	-> example int x = 0X10 or 0x10;
	-> literal value should be prefixed with 0X or 0x
	-> for extra digit a-f,we can use both lowercase and uppercase characters.this is one of very few ares
	   where java is not case sensitive.
	   
-> these are only possible ways to specify literal value for integral data types.
-> by default every integral literal is of int type but we can specify explictly as long type by suffix with
small l or capital L.
int x = 10; //valid
logn l = 10L; //valid
int x = 10l; //invalid
long l = 10; //valid

-> there is no direct way to specify byte and short literal explictly but indirectly we can specify.whenver
we are assigning integral literal to the byte variable and if the value within the range of byte then compiler
treats it automatically as byte literal.
byte b = 10; //valid
byte b = 127 //valid
byte b = 128 //invalid

short s = 32767; //valid
short s = 32768; //invalid
