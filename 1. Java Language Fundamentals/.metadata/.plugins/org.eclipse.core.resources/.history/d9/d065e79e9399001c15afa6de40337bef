Command Line Arguments:-> 
-> the arguments which are passing from command prompt are called command line arguments.
-> with these command line arguments JVM will create an array and by passing that array as argument JVM will call main method.
Example:->
java Test A B C

-> the main objective of command line argument is we can customize behaviour of the main method.

-> java uses string as command line argument because string is most used data type and we can convert to any other type such as primitive,boolean etc.
