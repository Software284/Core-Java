Command Line Arguments:-> 
-> the arguments which are passing from command prompt are called command line arguments.
-> with these command line arguments JVM will create an array and by passing that array as argument JVM will call main method.
Example:->
java Test A B C

-> the main objective of command line argument is we can customize behaviour of the main method.

-> java uses string as command line argument because string is most used data type and we can convert to any other type such as primitive,boolean etc.


Example1:-> 

class Test{
	public static void main(String args[]){
		for(int i = 0; i < args.length; i++){
			sysout(args[i]);
		}
	}
}

Example2:->
class Test{
	public static void main(String args[]){
		String[] argh = {"X","Y","Z"};
		args = argh;
		for(String s: args){
			syosut(s);
		}
	}
}
