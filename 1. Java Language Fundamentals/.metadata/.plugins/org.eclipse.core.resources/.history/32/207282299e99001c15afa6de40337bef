Java Language Coding Standard:-> 
==========================================================================================================================================================
-> whenever we are writing java code it is highly recomended to follow coding standards. whenever we are writing any component it's name should reflect
the purpose of that component(functionality).
-> the main advantage of this approach is readability and maintainability of the code will be improved.
Noob Style:->
class A{
	public int m1(int x,int y){
		return x+y;
	}
}

Pro Style:->
package com.lamichhane
public class Calculator{
	public static int add(int number1,int number2){
		return number1 + number2;
	}
}
===========================================================================================================================================================
Coding Standard For Classes:->
-> usually class names are nouns.
-> should starts with uppercase characters.
-> if it contains multiple words every inner word should start uppercase character.
Example:->
String
StringBuffer
Account
Dog

Coding Standards For Interfaces:->
-> usually class names are adjective.
-> should starts with uppercase character.
-> if it contains multiple words every inner word should starts with uppercase character.
Example:->
Runnable
Serializable
Comparable
RandomAccess

Coding Standards For Methods:-.
-> usually method names are either verbs or verb+nouns combination.
-> should starts with lowercase alphabet symbol.
-> if it contains multiple words then every inner word should start with uppercase character(CamelCase Convenction).
Example:
print();
sleep();
eat();
start();
getName();
setSalary();

Coding Standards For Variables:->
-> usually variables names are nouns.
-> should starts with lowercase alphabet symbol.
-> if it contains multiple words then every inner words should start with uppercase character(CamelCase
Convention).
Example:-> 
name
age 
salary
mobileNumber


Coding Standard For Constants:->
-> usually constant names are nouns.
-> should contain only uppercase characters.
-> if it contains multiple words then these words are seperated with _ symbol.
Example:->
MAX_VALUE
MAX_PRIORITY
NORM_PRIORITY
MIN_PRIORITY
PI

Note:-> we can declare constants with public static and final modifiers.

Java Bean Coding Standards:->
-> a java bean is a simple java class with the private properties and pubic getter and setter methods.
public class StudentBean{
	private String name;
	
	public void setName(String name){
		this.name = name;
	}
	public String getName(){
		return name;
	}
}
-> class names with the bean not a official convention from sun.
