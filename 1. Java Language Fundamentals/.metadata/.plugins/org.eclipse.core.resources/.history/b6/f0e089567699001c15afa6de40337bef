Var-args Method(Variable Number of argument method):->
-> until 1.4 version we can't declare a method with variable number of arguments.if there is a change in number of arguments compulsary we should go 
for new method.it increases length of the code and reduces readability.
-> to overcome this problem sun people introduced var-arg methods in 1.5 version.according to this we can declare a method which can take variable no
of arguments such type of methods are called var args methods.
-> we can declare a var-arg method as follows
m1(int... x);
