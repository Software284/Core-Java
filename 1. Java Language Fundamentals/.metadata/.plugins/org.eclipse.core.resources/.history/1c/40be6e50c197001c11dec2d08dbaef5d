-> A name in java program is called identifier which can be used for identification purpose.it can be
method name,variable name,class name,or label name.
public class Test {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		int x = 10;

	}

}
-> there are 5 identifiers in this program named:Test,main,String,args,x.


============================================================================================================
Rules for defining java identifiers:->
-> the only allowed characters in java identifiers are 
a-z
A-Z
0-9
$
_
if we are using any other character we will get compile time error.
Example:->
total_number -> valid
total#symbol -> invalid


-> identifiers can't start with the digits.
total123 -> valid
123total -> invalid

-> java identifiers are case sensitive.of course java language itself is treated as case sensitive 
programming language.
class test{
	int NUMBER = 10;
	int number = 10;
	int Number = 10;
}
we can differentiate with respect to case.


-> there is no length limit for java identifiers but it is not recommended to take too lengthly identifiers.
