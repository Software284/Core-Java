Types Of Assert Statements:-> thre are two types of assert statements 
i. Simple Version
ii. Augmented Version

i.Simple Version
syntax:
assert(b)
-> b should be boolean type.
-> if b is true then our assumption satisfied and hence rest of the program will be executed normally.
-> if b is false then our assumption fails i.e somewhere something goes wrong.and hence the program will
be terminated abnormally by rising assertions error.once we got assertions error we will analyze the code
and we can fix the problem.

Note:-> java enabling assertions.
java -ea class_name
for eclipse selet run as VM argument type -ea
by default assert statement won't be executed because assertions are disabled by default but we can enable
assertions by using above command.
