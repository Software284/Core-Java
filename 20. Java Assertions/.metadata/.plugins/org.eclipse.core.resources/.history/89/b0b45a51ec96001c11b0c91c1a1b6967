Introduction:->
-> very common way of debugging is usage of sop statements but the problem with sop's is after
fixing the bug compulsary we have to delete sop statements.otherwise these sop's will be executed
at runtime for every request,which creates performance problems and disturbs server logs.

-> to overcome these problem sun people introduced assertions concept in 1.4 version.
-> the main advantage of assertions when compared with sop's is after fixing the bug we are not
required to remove assert statements because they won't be executed by default at runtime.

-> based on our requirement we can enable and disable assetrions.and by default assertions are
disabled.
-> hence the main objective of assertions is to perform debugging.
-> usually we can perform debugging in development and test environments but not in production
environment hence assertions concept applicable for development and test environments but not 
for production.
-> it comes in 1.4 version.



Assert as identifier and keyword:->
-> assert keyword introduced in 1.4 version hence from 1.4 version onwards we can't use assert as
identifier otherwise we will get compile time error.
