Encapsulation:-> the process of binding data and corresponding methods into a single unit is nothing but
encapsulation.Example 
class student {
 data_members+methods;
 }
 if any component follows data hiding + abstraction such type of component is said to be encapsulated
 component.
 encapsulation = data hiding + absttraction

The main advantages of encapsulation are:->
-> we can achieve security 
-> enhancement will become easy 
-> it improves maintainablility of the application.
-> the main advantage of encapsulation is we can achive security but main dis-advantage of encapsulation
is it increases lenth of the code and slows down execution.

Tightly Encapsulated Class:-> a class is said to be tightly encapsulated if and only if each and every
variable declared as private.whethter class contains corresponding getter and setter methods are not
and whether these methods are declared as public or not these things we are not required to check.

Class A {
	private int x;
	}
-> it is tightly encapsulated class

Class B extends Class A {
  public int y;
  }
 -> it is not tightly encapsulated class
 
 Class C extends Class A {
   private int z;
   }
  -> it is tightly encapsulated class
  
  Note:-> if parent is not tightly encapsulated then no child class is tightly encapsulated.these all
  features such as data hiding,abstraction,encapsulation refers to the security.
