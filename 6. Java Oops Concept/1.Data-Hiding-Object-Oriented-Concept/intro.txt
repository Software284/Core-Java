Data Hiding:-> Outside person can't access our internl data directly or our internal data should not
go out directly this oop feature is nothing but data hiding.after validation or authentication outside person
can access our inernal data.
example1:-> after providing proper username and password we can able to 
access our gmail inbox information.
example2:-> even though we are valid customer of the bank we can able to access our account information and
we can't access others account information.

-> by declaring data member(variable) as private we can achive data hiding.
public class Account{
 private double balance;
 public double getBalance(){
 	//validation
 	return balance;
 }
 }
 -> the main advantage of data hiding is security.
 Note:-> it is highly recomended to declare data member(variable) as private.
