Method Signature:-> In java method signature consists of method name followed by argument types.
public static int m1(int i,float f)
return type is not part of method signature in java.

compiler will use method signature to resolve method calls.
within a class two method with a same signature not allowed.
class test {
 public void m1(int i){
 }
 public int m1(int x){
  return x;
 }
 
 public static void main(String args[]){
  test t = new test();
  t.m1(10);
 }
 }
 here compiler gives left and right.
