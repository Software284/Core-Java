Singleton Classes:-> for any java class if we are allowed to create only one object such type of class is called singleton
class.
Example:->
Runtime,BusinessDelegate,ServiceLocator etc

Advantage:->
-> if several people have same requirement then it is not recomended to create a separate object for every requirement.
we have to create only one object and we can re-use same object for every simillar requirement so that performance and 
memory utilization will be improved.this is the cental idea of singleton classes.

Example:->
Runtime r1 = Runtime.getRuntime();
Runtime r2 = Runtime.getRuntime();
Runtime rn = Runtime.getRuntime();

How to create our own singleton classes?
-> there are two approach to create singleton classes
i. private constructor

class Test {
	private static Test t = new Test();
	private Test(){
	}
	public static Test getTest(){
		return t;
	}
}

Test t1 = Test.getTest();
Test t2 = Test.getTest();
Test tn = Test.getTest();

ii. 
class Test {
	private static Test t = null;
	private Test(){
	}
	public static Test getTest(){
		if(t == null){
			t = new Test();
		}
		return t;
	}
}

Test t1 = Test.getTest();
Test t2 = Test.getTest();
Test tn = Test.getTest();
