Coupling:-> the degree of dependency between the components is called coupling.if dependency is more
then it is considered as tightly coupling and if dependency is less then it is considered as loosely
coupling.
Example:-> Tightly Coupled
class A {
 static int i = B.j;
 }

class B {
 static int j = C.k;
 }

class C {
 static int k = D.m1();
 }

class D {
 public stati int m1(){
  return 10;
  }
 }

the above components are said to be tightly coupled to each other because dependency between the
components is more.
tightly coupling is not a good programming practise because it has several serious dis-advantages.

i.Without effecting remaining components we can't modify any component and hence enhancement will 
become defficult.
ii.It suprases reusability:-> 
ii.
