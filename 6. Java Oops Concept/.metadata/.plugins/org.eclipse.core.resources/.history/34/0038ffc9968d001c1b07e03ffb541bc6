Coupling:-> the degree of dependency between the components is called coupling.if dependency is more
then it is considered as tightly coupling and if dependency is less then it is considered as loosely
coupling.
Example:-> 
class A {
 static int i = B.j;
 }

class B {
 static int j = C.k;
 }

class C {
 static int k = D.m1();
 }

class D {
 public stati int m1(){
  return 10;
  }
 }
