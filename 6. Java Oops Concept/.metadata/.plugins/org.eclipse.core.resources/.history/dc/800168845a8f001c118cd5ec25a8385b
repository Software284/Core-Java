Object Type Casting:-> we can use parent reference to hold child object.
Example:->
Object o = new String("mahesh")
we can use interface reference to hold implemented class object
Example:-> 
Runnable r = new Thread()

Syntax:
A  b = (C)d;
where 
A = class/interface name
b = reference variable name
C = class/interface name
d = reference variable name

Mantra 1(compile time checking one):-> the type of 'd' and 'C' must have some relation either child to
parent or parent to child or same type otherwise we will get compile time error saying inconvertible 
types found 'd' type required 'C'.

Example 1:-
Object o = new String("durga")
StringBuffer sb = (StringBuffer)o
this statement is perfect valid.

Example 2:-> 
String s = new String("mahesh");
StringBuffer sb = (StrinBuffer)s;
this statement is invalid.throws CE inconvertible types because there is no relationship between
StringBuffer and String.

Mantra 2(compile time checking 2):->'C' must be either same or derived type of 'A' otherwise we will
get compile time error saying incompatible types found 'C' required 'A'.

Example1:->
Object o = new String("durga")
StringBuffer sb = (StringBuffer)o
this statement is perfect valid.

Example2:->
Object o = new String("mahesh")
StringBuffer bf = (String)o
this statement is prefectly invalid.it throws incompatible type exception.


Mantra3(Runtime Checking):-> runtime object type of 'd' must be either same or derived type of 'C' otherwise 
we will get runitme exception saying class cast exception.
Example1:->
Object o = new String("durga")
StringBuffer sb = (StringBuffer)o
we will get runtime exception saying class cast exception java.lang.string can not be cast to string buffer.

Object o = new String("durga")
Object o1 = String(o)
prefectly valid statements.



Type Casting:-> strictly speaking throught type casting we are not creating any new object.for the existing
object we are providing another type of reference variable that is we are performing type casting not object
casting.
Example1:->
String s = new String("maehsh");
Object o = (Object)s;

Example2:->
Integer I = new Integer(10);
Number n = Number(I);
Object o = (Object)n;
sysout(I==n) //true
sysout(n==o) //true

we can also write in single line as
