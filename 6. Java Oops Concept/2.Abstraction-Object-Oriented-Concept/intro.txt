Abstraction:-> Hiding internal implementation and just highlight the set of service we are offering, is the
concept of abstraction.for Example Bank provide following services in the atm
-> Withdraw
-> Deposit 
-> Check Balance
these services gave the services without highlighting internal implementation.
The main advantage of abstraction are:->
i. we can achive security because we are not highlighting our internal implementation.
ii. without affecting outside person we can able to perform any type of changes in our internal system and
hence enhancement will become easy.
iii. it improves maintainablility of the applications.
iv. it improves easyness to use our system.

by using interfaces and abstract classes we can implement abstraction.
