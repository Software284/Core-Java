Difference Between ClassNotFoundException VS NoClassDefFoundError:->

-> for hard coded class names,at runtime if the corresponding .class file is not available then we will get runtime
exception saying NoClassDefFoundError,which is unchecked.
Example:
Test t = new Test();
at runtime if Test.class file is not available then we will get runtime exception saying NoClassDefFoundError:Test.

-> for dynamically provided class names at runtime if the corresponding .class file is not available then we will get
runtime exception saying ClassNotFoundException,which is checked exception.
Example:
Object o = Class.forName(args[0]).newInstance();
java Test Student
at runtime if Student.class file not available then we will get runtime exception saying ClassNotFoundException:Student.
