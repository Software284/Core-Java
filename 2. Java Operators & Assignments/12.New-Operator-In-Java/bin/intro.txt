New Operator:-> 
-> we can use new operator to create object.
Example:
Test t = new Test();

Note:->
-> after creating an object constructor will be executed to perform initialization of an object hence constructor is
not for creation of object and it is for initialization of an object.
-> in java we have only new keyword but not delete keyword because destruction of useless objects is the 
responsibility of garbage collector.
