instanceof VS instanceOf():->
-> instanceof is an operator in java. we can use instanceof to check whether the given object is of particular type
or not and we know type at the beginning.
Example:
Thread t = new Thread();
System.out.println(t instanceof Runnable);
System.out.println(t instanceof String);

output:->
true
false

-> isInstance is a method present in java.lang.Class.we can use isInstance method to check whether the given object 
is of particular type or not.and we don't know the type at the begining and it is available dynamically at run time.

Example:
Thread t = new Thread();
System.out.println(Class.forName(args[0]).isInstance(t));
