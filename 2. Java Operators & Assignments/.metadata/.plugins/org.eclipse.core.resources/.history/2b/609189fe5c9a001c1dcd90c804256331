Assignments Operators:->
-> there are three types of assignment operators 
i. simple assignment 
Example:
int x = 10;

ii. chained assignment
Example:
int a = b = c = d = 20;
or int a=20,b=20,c=20,d=20;

iii. compound assignment
Example:
a += 20;

total assignemtn:
+=
*=
/=
%=
-=
&=
|=
^=
>>=
>>>=
<<=

-> sometimes assignment operator mixed with some other operator such type of assignment operator are called compund
assignment operators.

byte b = 10;
b = b + 1;
sysout(b);

byte b = 10;
b++;
syosut(b);

byte b = 10;
b += 1;
sysout(b);
