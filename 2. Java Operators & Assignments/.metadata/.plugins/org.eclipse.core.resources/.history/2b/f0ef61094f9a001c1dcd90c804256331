Bitwise operators(&,|,^):-> 

& -> AND :-> returns true iff both arguments are true.
| -> OR :-> returns true if at least one argument is true.
^ -> X-OR: -> returns true if and only if both arguments are different.

Example:->
sysout(true & false); //false
sysout(true | false); //true
sysout(true ^ false); //true


-> we can apply these operators for integral types also.

sysout(4 & 5);
  100
+ 101
--------
  100
// 4 answer

sysout(4 | 5);
  100
+ 101
-------
  101
//5 answer

sysout(4 ^ 5);
  100
+ 101
---------
  001
//1 answer





Bitwise Complement Operator(~):-> we can apply this operator only for integral types but not for boolean type.if we
are trying to apply for boolean type then we will get compile time error.
sysout(~true);
CE:operator ~ cannot be applied to boolean
sysout(~4)
it is int variable so size is 32bit
0 0000....................000100
~4 = 1111.................111011
it's 2's complement can be
0000................000100
+                        1
-----------------------------
0000................00101
which is -5 is the answer

Note:-> this mechanism is same for &,|,^ but it does not affect so that we don't reference as this.
