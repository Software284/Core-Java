New Vs NewInstance:->
-> we can use new operator to create an object if we know class name at the beginning.
Example:
Test t  = new Test();
Student s = new Student();
Customer c = new Customer();

-> newInstance is a method present in Class class,we can use new instance method to create object if we don't know
class name at the beginnning and it is available dynamically at runitme.

Example:
Object o = Class.forName(args[0]).newInstance();
System.out.println("Object Created For="+o.getClass().getName());

-> in real world newInstance operator is used in servert.when every request comes in servlet container automatically
creates servlet object from web.xml file using newInstance method.

-> in general case it is optional to generate constuctor.in general if we don't provide our own no arg constructor
then compiler automatically add no arg constructor.if we provide our own constructor then our no-arg constructor will
be invoked.but in new instance method compiler automatically add the constructor and creates an object.

-> in the case of new operator based on our requirement we can invoke any constructor.
Example
Test t = new Test();
Test t1 = new Test(10);
Test t2 = new Test("durga");

but new instance method interanlly calls no arg constructor.hence to use new instance method compulsary corresponding
should contain no arg constructor.otherwise we will get runtime exception saying instantation exception.

-> while using new operator at runtime if the corresponding .class file is not available then we will get runtime
exception saying NoClassDefFoundError:Test.
Example:
Test t = new Test();
at runtime if Test.class file is not available then we will get runtime exception saying noclassdeffound error.

-> while using newinstance method at runtime if the corresponding .class file is not available then we will get
runtime exception saying ClassNotFoundException.
Example
Object o = Class.forName(args[0]).newInstance();
java Test Test123
at runtime if Test123.class file is not available then we will get runtime exception saying ClassNotFoundException:Test
123.

new Vs newInstance:->
-> it is an operator in java VS it is a method present in java.lang.Class.
-> we can use new operator to create objects if we know class name at the beginnning
