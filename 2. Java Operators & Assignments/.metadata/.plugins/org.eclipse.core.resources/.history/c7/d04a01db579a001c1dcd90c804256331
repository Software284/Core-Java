Type-cast Operator:->
-> there are two types of type-casting 
i. implict type casting
ii. explict type casting

Implict Type-casting:->
-> compiler is responsible to perform implict type-casting.
-> whenever we are assigning smaller data type value to bigger data type variable implict type-casting will be
performed.
-> it is also know as widening or upcasting.
-> there is no loss of information in this type casting.
-> the following are various possible converions where implict type casting will be performed.

int x = 'a';
sysout(x); //97
compiler converts char to int automatically by implict type-casting

double d = 10;
sysout(d); //10.0
compiler converts int  to double  automatically by implict type-casting

byte -> short
byte -> int
char -> int
short -> int
int -> long



Explict Type-cating:->
-> programmer is responsible to perform explict type casting.
-> whenever we are assigning bigger data type value to smaller data type variable then explict type casting is required.
-> it is also known as narrowing or downcasting.
-> there may be a chance of loss of information in this type casting.

int x = 130;
byte b = x; // CE: possible loss of precesion found int required byte
byte b = (byte)x; //valid
sysout(b);

output:->
-126
