Type-cast Operator:->
-> there are two types of type-casting 
i. implict type casting
ii. explict type casting

Implict Type-casting:->
-> compiler is responsible to perform implict type-casting.
-> whenever we are assigning smaller data type value to bigger data type variable implict type-casting will be
performed.
-> it is also know as widening or upcasting.
-> there is no loss of information in this type casting.
-> the following are various possible converions where implict type casting will be performed.

int x = 'a';
sysout(x); //97
compiler converts char to int automatically by implict type-casting

double d = 10;
sysout(d); //10.0
compiler converts int  to double  automatically by implict type-casting

byte -> short
byte -> int
char -> int
short -> int
int -> long



Explict Type-cating:->
-> programmer is responsible to perform explict type casting.
-> whenever we are assigning bigger data type value to smaller data type variable then explict type casting is required.
-> it is also known as narrowing or downcasting.
-> there may be a chance of loss of information in this type casting.

int x = 130;
byte b = x; // CE: possible loss of precesion found int required byte
byte b = (byte)x; //valid
sysout(b);

output:->
-126

Note:-> 

byte	->	short
					 int -> long -> float -> double 
	  char 
	  
Left -> Right => Implict Type casting
Right -> left => Explict Type casting

-> whenever we are assigning bigger data type value to smaller data type variable by explict type casting. the most 
significant bit will be lost.we have consider only LSB bits.

How 130 becomes -126 in above example?
How this loss of information is happening?

int x = 130 -> 0 000000....010000010
byte b = (byte)x; => 10000010
2's complement of 0000010
1111101
+     1
--------
1111110

which is 126 
now final answer is -126

-> 

int x = 150;
Short s = (Short)x;
sysout(s);

output:->
150

byte b = (byte)x;
sysout(b);

output:->
-106


-> if we assigned floating point values to the integral types by explicit type casting.
double d = 130.456;
int x = (int) d;
sysout(x); //130

byte b = (byte)d;
sysout(b); // -126
