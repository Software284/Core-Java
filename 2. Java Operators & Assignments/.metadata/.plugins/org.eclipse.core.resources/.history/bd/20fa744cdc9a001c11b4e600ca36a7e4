instanceof VS instanceOf():->
-> instanceof is an operator in java. we can use instanceof to check whether the given object is of particular type
or not and we know type at the beginning.
Example:
Thread t = new Thread();
System.out.println(t instanceof Runnable);
System.out.println(t instanceof String);

output:->
true
false
