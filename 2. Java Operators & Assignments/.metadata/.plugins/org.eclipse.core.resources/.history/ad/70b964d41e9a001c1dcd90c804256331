-> the only overloaded operator in java is '+' operator sometimes it act as arithmetic addition operator and sometimes
it acts as string concatination operator.

-> if alteast one argument is string type then plus operator acts as concatination operator and if both arguments are
number type then plus operator acts as arithemetic addition operator.

String a = "durga";
int b=10,c=20,d=30;
sysout(a+b+c+d); //durga102030
sysout(b+c+d+a); //60durga
sysout(b+c+a+d); //30durga30
syosut(b+a+c+d); //10durga2030


String a = "durga";
int b = 10,c=20,d=30;

a = b+c+d; // invalid CE:incompatible types found int required java.lang.String
a = a+b+c; // valid
b = a+c+d; //invalid CE: incompatible types found java.lang.String requred int
b = b+c+d; //valid
