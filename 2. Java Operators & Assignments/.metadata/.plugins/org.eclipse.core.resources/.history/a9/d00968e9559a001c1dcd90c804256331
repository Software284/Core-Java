Type-cast Operator:->
-> there are two types of type-casting 
i. implict type casting
ii. explict type casting

Implict Type-casting:->
-> 

int x = 'a';
sysout(x); //97
compiler converts char to int automatically by implict type-casting

double d = 10;
sysout(d); //10.0
compiler converts int  to double  automatically by implict type-casting
