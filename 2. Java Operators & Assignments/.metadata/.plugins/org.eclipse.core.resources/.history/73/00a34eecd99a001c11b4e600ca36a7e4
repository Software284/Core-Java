Difference Between ClassNotFoundException VS NoClassDefFoundError:->

-> for hard coded class names,at runtime if the corresponding .class file is not available then we will get runtime

Example:
Test t = new Test();
at runtime if Test.class file is not available then we will get runtime exception saying NoClassDefFoundError:Test.
