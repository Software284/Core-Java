-> there are multiple operators with same precedence then evaluation will be done from left to right.
Example:
public class Test {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	
		System.out.println(m1(1)+m1(2) * m1(3)/m1(4)+m1(5)*m1(6));

	}
	
	public static int m1(int i) {
		System.out.println(i);
		return i;
	}

}

1 + 2 * 3 / 4 + 5 * 6;
1 + 6 / 4 + 5 * 6
1 + 1 + 5 * 6
1 + 1 + 30
32

-> in java we have only operator precedence but not operand precedence.before applying any operator all operands will
be evaluated from left to right.
