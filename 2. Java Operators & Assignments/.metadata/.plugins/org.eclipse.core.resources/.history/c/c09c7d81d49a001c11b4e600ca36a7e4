New Vs NewInstance:->
-> we can use new operator to create an object if we know class name at the beginning.
Example:
Test t  = new Test();
Student s = new Student();
Customer c = new Customer();

-> newInstance is a method present in Class class,we can use new instance method to create object if we don't know
class name at the beginnning and it is available dynamically at runitme.

Example:
Object o = Class.forName(args[0]).newInstance();
System.out.println("Object Created For="+o.getClass().getName());
