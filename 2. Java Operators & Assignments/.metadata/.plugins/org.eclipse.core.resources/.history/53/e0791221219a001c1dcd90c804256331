sysout(10 < 20); // true
sysout('a' < 10); //false
sysout('a' < 97.6); //true
sysout('a' > 'A'); //true
sysout(true > false);// CE:operator > can't be applied to boolean,boolean

-> we can't applied relational operator for object types.
Example:
sysout("mahesh" > "lamichhane");
CE:operator > can't be applied to java.lang.String,java.lang.String.

-> Nesting of relational operators is not allowed otherwise we will get compile time error.
Example:
sysout(10<20); //true
sysout(10<20<30);
CE:operator < can't be applied to boolean,int
