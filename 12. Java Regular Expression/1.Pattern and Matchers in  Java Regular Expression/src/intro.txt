Regular Expression:-> If we want to represent a group of strings according to a particular pattern then we should go for 
regular expressions. we can write regular expression to represent all valid mobile numbers.we can
write regular expression to represent all mail ids.
The important application areas of regular expression are:->
i. to develop validation frameworks 
ii. to develop pattern matching applications(Control F in windows)
iii. to develop translators like assembers compilers interpreters etc.
iv. to develop digital circuits.
v. to develop communication protocols like tcp/ip,udp etc.


Pattern :-> pattern object is a compile version of regular expression that is it is a java equivalent 
object of pattern.we can create a pattern a pattern object by using compile method of pattern class.
public static Pattern compile(String re)

Matcher:-> we can use matcher object to check the given pattern in the target string.we can create a matcher
object by using matcher method of pattern class.
public Matcher matcher(String target)

Important methods of matcher class:-> 
boolean find():-> it attemps to find next match and returns true if it is available.
int start() :-> it returns start index of the match
int end():-> it returns n+1 end index of the match
String group():-> it returns the matched pattern content

Note:-Pattern and Matcher classes present in java.util.regex package and introduced in 1.4 version.
