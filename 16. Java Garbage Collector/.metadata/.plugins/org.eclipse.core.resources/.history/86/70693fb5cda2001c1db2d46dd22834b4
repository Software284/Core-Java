Garbage Collection:-> 
-> in old languages like c++ programmer is responsible to create new object and to destroy useless
objects.usually programmer taking very much care while creating objects and neglecting destruction
of useless objects because of his neglectence at certain point for creation of new object sufficient
memory may not be available(because total memory filled with useless objects only).and total 
application will be down with memory problems hence out of memory error is very common problem in
old languages like c++.

-> but in java programmer is responsible only for creation of objects and programmer is not 
responsible to destroy useless objects.sun people provided one assistant to destroy useless objects
this assistant is always running in the background(daemon thread) and destroy useless objects.just
because of this assistant the chance of failing java program with memory problems is very very
low.this assistant is nothing but garbage collector.

-> hence the main objective of garbage collector is to destroy useless objects.

====================================================================================================

The ways to make object eligible for GC:-> even though programmer is not responsible to destroy 
useless objects it is highly recommended to make an object eligible for GC if it is no longer
required.
an object is said to be eligible for GC if and only if it doesn't contain any reference variable.
the following are various ways to make an object eligible for GC.

case-I:-> nulifiying the reference variable
-> if an object no longer required then assign null to all it's reference variables then that object
automatically eligible for garbage collection.this apporach is nothing but nullifying the reference
variable.
Example:
Student s1 = new Student();
Student s2 = new Student();
//no object are eligible for garbage collection
.
.
s1 = null;
//one object eligible for garbage collection
.
.
.
s2 = null;
// two object eligible for garbage collection

case-II:-> Reassigning the reference variable
-> if an object no longer required then reassign it's reference variable to some other objects
then old object by default eligible for garbage collection.





Student s1 = new Student();
Student s2 = new Student();
//no object eligible for garbage collection
.
.
.
s1 = new Student();
// one object eligible for garbage collection
.
.
.
s2 = s1;
// two object eligilbe for garbage collection


case-III:-> Objects created inside a method
-> the objects which are created inside a method are by default eligible for GC once method completes.
Example1:
class Test{
	public static void main(String args[]){
		m1();
	}
	
	public static void m1(){
		Student s1 = new Student();
		Student s2 = new Student();
	}
}
//after completion of m1 method both 2 objects eligible for GC.

Example2:->
class Test{
	public static void main(String args[]){
		Student s = m1();
	}
	
	public static Student m1(){
		Student s1 =  new Student();
		Student s2 = new Student();
		return s1;
	}
}
//here only s2 object is eligible for GC.

Example3:->
class Test{
	public static void main(String args[]){
		m1();
	}
	
	public static Student m1(){
		Student s1 =  new Student();
		Student s2 = new Student();
		return s1;
	}
}
//here 2 object eligible for GC


Example4:->

class Test{
	static student s;
	public static void main(String args[]){
		m1();
	}
	
	public static Student m1(){
		s =  new Student();
		Student s1 = new student();
	}
}
//only one object s1 object is eligible for GC.

Case-IV:-> Island of Isolation

class Test{
	Test i;
	
	public static void main(String args[]){
		Test t1 = new Test();
		Test t2 = new Test();
		Test t3 = new Test();
		//no object eligible for GC
		
		
		t1.i = t2;
		t2.i = t3;
		t3.i = t1;
		//no object eligible for GC
		
		t1 = null;
		//no object eligible for GC
		
		t2 = null;
		//no object eligible for GC
		
		t3 = null;
		//all 3 object are eligible for GC
	}
}

Note:->
-> if an object doesn't contain any reference variable then it is eligible for garbage collection always.
-> even though object having references sometimes it is eligible for garbage collection(if all references
are internal references).example island of isolation.

=============================================================================================================

The ways for requesting JVM to run GC:-> once we made an object eligible GC it may not be destroyed immediate
ly by garbage collector.whenever JVM run GC then only the object will be destroyed but when exactly JVM
run garbage collector we can't expect it is varied from JVM to JVM.instead of waiting until JVM run GC
we can request JVM to run garbage collector programatically but whether JVM accept our request or not there
is no gurantee but most of the times JVM accept our request.the following are two ways for requesting JVM
to run a garbage collector.

i. By using System class
-> System class contains static method gc for this purpose.
System.gc();

ii. By using Runtime class
-> java application can communicate with JVM by using Runtime object.
-> Runtime class present in java.lang package and it is a singleton class.
-> we can create runtime object by using Runtime.getRuntime method.

Example:
public class Test {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Runtime r = Runtime.getRuntime();
		System.out.println("Total Heap Memory="+r.totalMemory());
		System.out.println("Free Heap Memory="+r.freeMemory());
		r.gc();

	}

}

Note:-> 
-> gc method present in system class is a static method whereas gc method present in runtime class
is instance method.
-> it is convinient to use System class gc method when compared with runtime class gc method.
-> with respect to performance it is highly recommended to use runtime class gc method when compared with
system class gc method because system class gc method internally calls runtime class gc method.

class Sytem{
	public static void gc(){
		Runtime.getRuntime().gc();
	}
}



=============================================================================================================
Finalization:-> 
-> just before destroying an object garbage collector calls finalize method to perform cleanup activities.
-> once finalize method completes automatically garbage collector destroys that object.
-> finalize method present in object class with the following declaration.
protected void finalize throws Throwable
-> we can override finalize method in our class to define our own cleanup activities.

Loopholes:

case-I:-> just before destroying an object garbage collector calls finalize method on the object which is eligible
for gc then the corresponding class finalize method will be executed.for example string object eligible for gc
then string class finalize method will be executed but not Test class finalize method.


class Test{
	public static void main(String args[]){
		String s = new String("durga");
		s = null;
		System.gc();
		System.out.println("End of main");
	}
	
	public void finalize(){
		System.out.println("finalize method called");
	}
}

output:
End of main

-> here String class finalize method will be called not Test class finalization method.if we replace string object
with test class object then output may be
End of main
finalize method classed
or
finalize method called
End of main
or 
End of main



Case-II:-> based on our requirement we can call finalize method explictly then it will be executed just like a
normal method call and object won't be destroyed.
class Test {
	public static void main(String args[]){
		Test t = new Test();
		t.finalize();
		t.finalize();
		t = null;
		System.gc();
		System.out.println("End of Main");
	}
	
	public void finalize(){
		System.out.println("Finalize Method Called");
	}
}

output:
Finalize Method Called
Finalize Method Called
End of Main
Finalize Method Called

note:-> last finalize method called by garbage collector.if we are calling finalize method explictly then it will
be executed like a normal method call and object won't destroyed.if garbage collector calls finalize method then
object will be destroyed.
