Roles of new keyword and constructor:->
The purpose of constructor is:
-> To Initialize an object but not to create an object.
-> Whenever we are creating an object after object creation automatically constructor will be 
executed to initialize that object
-> object creation by new operator then initialization by constructor.
-> Before constructor only object is ready and hence within the constructor we can access object 
properties like hash code.
====================================================================================================
-> Whenever we are creating child class object whether parent object will be created or not??

-> Whenever we are creating child class object,what is the need of executing parent class
constructor??

-> Anyway we can not create object for abstract class either directly or indirectly,but abstract
class can contain constructor. what is the need??

-> Anyway we can not create object for abstract class and interface. Abstract class can contain
constructor but interfaces doesn't why??

-> Inside interface we can take only abstract methods.But in abstract class also we can take only
abstract methods based on our requirement. then what is the need of interface? i.e is it possilbe
to replace interface concept with abstract class?

:-> 
-> The main purpose of constructor is to perform initialization of an object i.e to provide values for instance
variable.
-> Abstract class can contain instance variable which are requried for child class object to perform initialization
of these instance variable the constructor is required inside abstract class.
-> but every variable present inside interface is always publi static and final whether we are declaring or not
and every interface variable we should perform initialization at the time of declaration and hence inside 
interface there is no chance of existing instance variable.
-> due to this initialization of instance variable concept not applicable for interfaces.
-> hence constructor concept not required for interface.

constructor??

:-> 
class Person{
	String name,
	int age;
	
	Person(String name,int age){
		this.name = name;
		this.age = age;
	}
}

class Student extends Person{
	 int roll;
	 int marks;
	 
	 Student(int roll,int marks){
	 	this.roll = roll;
	 	this.marks = marks;
	 }
}





-> whenever we are creating an object automatically constructor will be executed but it may be one constructor
or multiple constructors.
