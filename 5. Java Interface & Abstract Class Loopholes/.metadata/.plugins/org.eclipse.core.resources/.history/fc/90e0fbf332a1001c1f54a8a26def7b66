Roles of new keyword and constructor:->
-> Whenever we are creating child class object whether parent object will be created or not??

-> Whenever we are creating child class object,what is the need of executing parent class
constructor??

-> Anyway we can not create object for abstract class either directly or indirectly,but abstract
class can contain constructor. what is the need??

-> Anyway we can not create object for abstract class and interface. Abstract class can contain
constructor but interfaces doesn't why??

-> Inside interface we can take only abstract methods.But in abstract class also we can take only
abstract methods based on our requirement. then what is the need of interface? i.e is it possilbe
to replace interface concept with abstract class?

*:-> the main object of new operator is to create an object and the main puprpose of constructor is
to initialze object.first object will be created by using new operator and then initialization will
be performed by constructor.
